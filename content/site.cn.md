Don't ever worry about admission again: TICKETH is the **convenient and secure way to book or sell tickets to events**, both online or offline. Simply enjoy your experiences thanks to our smart blockchain technology.

We were probably the first in Germany to sell tickets using the Ethereum Blockchain and not via the traditional internet. The Ethereum Blockchain and the Smart Contracts we programmed atop of it automatically establish trust between buyers and sellers of event tickets. So you get what you order, no questions asked.
