Introtitle: Our Mission

----

Introtext: 

Don't ever worry about your ticket again: TICKETH is the convenient and secure way to book or sell tickets to events, both online or offline. Simply enjoy your experiences thanks to our smart blockchain technology.

We were probably the first in Germany to sell tickets using the Ethereum Blockchain and not via the traditional internet. The Ethereum Blockchain, and the Smart Contracts we programmed atop, automatically establish trust between buyers and sellers of event tickets. So you get what you order, and just what you order, no questions asked.

You can pay your ticket fee with crypto currencies like BitCoin, Ethereum or popular AltCoins, of course. But we also offer PayPal and other traditional payment options and widespread currencies for your convenience (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, a.k.a. FIAT money).

But there’s a lot more we can do for event participants, booking agents, and event organizers. At present, however, we chose not to reveal our disruptive strategy – but we encourage you to stay tuned for the latest updates by subscribing to our newsletter.

    In our successful pilot project we brokered the tickets for the TEDx Event at Frankfurt School, Dec. 2, 2017. The TEDx night’s motto was: “Push yourself and remove boundaries”. We did just that!
    
    More than 100 people booked their tickets and seamlessly switched from the internet to the Ethereum blockchain and back during the process. All tickets were paid in EUR and most by using PayPal+ and we processed a four-digit money sum for the first time. On-site ticket validation was enabled by our own mobile-ready Ethereum App. TICKETH proved to be the key to the experience, yeay!

  title: Ethereum Central Germany MeetUp
  text: >
    The idea behind TICKETH was developed by
    Simon Dosch and Immo Garlichs at
    Frankfurt School, and further refined at
    the Ethereum Central Germany MeetUp by
    Roman Kessler and Adam Siwy. In the
    future, TICKETH will take care of the
    ticketing to the MeetUp – thereby
    reducing no-show rates and offering more
    flexibility to both the organizers and
    attendees. If you are curious about what
    Ethereum can do, you should join the
    MeetUp. You may also get a chance to
    help us further develop the TICKETH.
    Stay tuned!
