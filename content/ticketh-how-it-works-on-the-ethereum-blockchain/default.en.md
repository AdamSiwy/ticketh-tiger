We chose the Ethereum Blockchain, which is run by Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and has been built by Chief Scientist Vitalik Buterin and his team. (Check out (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66SaEDzlmP4 text:  Ethereum in 25 Minutes target: blank) by Vitalik Buterin)

With this open-source technology we are making it easier and more secure for buyers and sellers to control every phase of the ticketing process without hassle. If your think of the technology that enables BitCoin, the open BitCoin blockchain, as a calculator which enables crypto money generation (mining) and money transfers from A to B, the Ethereum blockchain is much more than that.

Some people speak of Ethereum as a decentralized “world computer”, where many decentralized computers around the globe continuously update a common databank. TICKETH uses this “world computer”. It is a Decentralized Application (a.k.a. DAP) to help you book and sell tickets by way of using our immutable and secure smart contract. There is virtually no way you can be cheated during the process because we apply technology that simply makes that impossible. Hence, we are part of a new generation network, which some call the “Internet of Value”.

It’s still early days for blockchain applications, but you should not be underestimating the power of this technology! Much like the personal computer, the internet, and smartphones the blockchain will revolutionize our world. We will continue to add features to TICKETH (see roadmap below), but our Pilot (see milestones above) already proofs that we are fit to tackle several problems in the ticketing industry.

PS: No, we do not plan to launch an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as we will not participate in the highly speculative bubble. Sorry… we simply want to you to your enjoy event experiences and presently do not need any token or coin to make that possible.
